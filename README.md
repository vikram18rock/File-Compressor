# File-Zipper

This application is a loss-less data compression application, which means it compresses the input data file into a smaller output file size than the input file. The input file can be retrieved again.

The Huffman coding algorithm was used, which takes the data and assigns different prefix codes (binary codes) based on the frequency of elements that occur. These binary codes would be the output file, which is smaller in size and also contains the complete data.
